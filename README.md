# Minor Audio Inconvenience

Set volume for individual sounds.

# This is a WIP rewrite of the mod. The stable version of the mod is in `main` for Fabric, and `neoforge` for NeoForge. 

## Usage
The `minecraft:weather.rain` sound is disabled by default. New sounds can be added to the configuration manually through the config screen (With Mod Menu: Mods -> Minor Audio Inconvenience, Without Mod Menu: `/owo-config minor-audio-inconvenience`) or using the "Set volume for a sound..." menu (Options... -> Music & Sounds... -> Set sound volume)
